1. Importing the Relevant Libraries
Code: The notebook begins by importing essential Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. These libraries are used for numerical computations, data manipulation, and visualization.
Explanation: Highlight the importance of these libraries in data science and how they facilitate efficient data analysis and visualization.
2. Loading the Dataset
Code: The dataset is loaded using pandas and an initial preview of the data is shown using df.head().
Explanation: Emphasize the significance of understanding the structure of the dataset early on.
3. Data Inspection
Code: Commands like df.shape, df.info(), df.describe(), df.isnull().sum(), and df.duplicated().sum() are used to inspect the dataset.
Explanation: Discuss how these functions help in identifying the dataset's dimensions, data types, summary statistics, missing values, and duplicate entries.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Code: Various analyses are performed, including checking the skewness of numerical columns, visualizing target label imbalance, and plotting a heatmap and cluster map for correlation analysis.
Explanation: Explain the purpose of EDA in uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, which is crucial for informed feature engineering and model selection.
5. Feature Engineering
Code: Includes feature transformation techniques such as log, reciprocal, square root, square, and power transformations applied to skewed columns.
Explanation: Illustrate how feature engineering can transform raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models.
6. Model Training
Code: Different machine learning models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, etc.) are trained using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Explanation: Describe the importance of model selection and hyperparameter tuning in achieving optimal model performance.
7. Optimized Models Performance Comparison
Code: Performance of the models is compared using metrics like accuracy.
Explanation: Talk about the criteria used to evaluate model performance and why accuracy (or any other metric used) is important in this context.
8. Saving the Best Performing Model
Code: The best model is saved using joblib for future use.
Explanation: Highlight the significance of model serialization in deploying machine learning models to production environments.
9. Backup Model and Cleanup
Code: A backup model is also saved, and memory cleanup is performed using gc.collect().
Explanation: Explain the importance of having backup models and memory management in large-scale data processing.
